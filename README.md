# Simulation-Game-Of-Life
The present work is the first example of the simulation of the game of life, in which it contains a research on the subject, and an example that was developed in python, this notebook complies with the expected results that were established, once the algorithm does not find more living cells, it will proceed to create a file in excel in which it will load each one of the iterations and the number of alive cells for each one, and in the end it will show us a graph in which you can better appreciate the results obtained.
